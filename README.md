FIFA World Cup Project Documentation



Introduction

For my first-ever SQL and Tableau project, I chose to work with the FIFA World Cup data as I have a personal interest in football and find the topic fascinating. The dataset was readily available online and included information about all World Cup tournaments from 1930 to 2014, such as participating countries, goals, and winners etc..
The FIFA World Cup dataset was well-structured, with clear column headers and consistent formatting, making it easy for me as a beginner to write SQL queries and create visualizations in Tableau. It was relatively easy to understand and work with, providing me with a great starting point to develop my skills in SQL and Tableau, while also learning more about one of my favorite topics.
I obtained the data from a publicly available CSV file on Kaggle and transferred it to an Excel spreadsheet for initial exploration and data cleaning. Once I had a better understanding of the data, I imported it into SQL Server.
The FIFA World Cup data was structured data, with clear column headers and consistent formatting, which made it easy to work with in both Excel and SQL Server. The data was organized into multiple tables, each containing information about different aspects of the World Cup.


Data Exploration


To gain a deeper understanding of the FIFA World Cup data, I used both SQL Server and Tableau Public. With SQL queries, I was able to answer questions about the tournament and extract relevant information. For instance, I queried to find out the winner of the world cup in 1930, the total number of goals scored by each country that has won the FIFA World Cup, and the total number of goals scored in 2014 and more.
To visualize my findings and gain further insights, I used Tableau Public to create interactive dashboards. For instance, I created a chart that showed the winners of the world cup each year, starting with Uruguay as the first country to win the world cup in 1930.
The combination of SQL queries and Tableau visualizations allowed me to explore the data from different angles and obtain valuable insights.

Conclusion

After exploring and analyzing the FIFA World Cup data using SQL and Tableau, I discovered interesting insights into the tournament's history and trends. Brazil emerged as the most successful country in World Cup history, winning the title five times. However, the study had its limitations as the data only included information up to the 2014 tournament and might have contained some inaccuracies or errors that could have affected my analysis.
To enhance the analysis of the FIFA World Cup data, future work could include including data from recent tournaments and conducting more in-depth analyses to explore the relationship between a team's FIFA ranking and its performance in the World Cup, among others.
Overall, although the project was my first-ever data analysis, I found it engaging. The project required significant effort and time to prepare and analyze the data, but the insights gained from the analysis made it worthwhile. Consequently, I would recommend the dataset to anyone interested in learning more about the FIFA World Cup and uncovering new insights.
